### “Is the cloud secure?” to “Am I using the cloud securely?”

**Develop an enterprise cloud strategy**

Increased guidance allows for:

- Better requirement analysis
- More sophisticated architectural planning
- More flexible risk acceptance processes

**Apply risk management practices to support cloud decisions**

- *Accepting some risk* is necessary for leveraging public cloud services, but *ignoring* these risks can be *dangerous*.

### **Mitigate cloud risks**

- ***Implement a strong security posture***
- ***Conduct regular security assessments:***
- ***Ensure compliance***
- ***Train employees***
- ***Use secure APIs & SDKs***

## **Risk appetite**

Risk appetite can also be described as an organization's risk capacity, or the maximum amount of [residual risk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/residual-risk) it will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place

### Factors that influence risk appetite

Risk appetite, an integral component of enterprise risk management, can be influenced by a wide variety of factors:

- The organization's culture.
- The organization's industry.
- The organization's competitors.
- Types of initiatives the organization pursues.
- The organization's current industry position and financial strength.

## Data governance is not the same as data management

**What is meant by governance?**

*Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.*

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.

- The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent

DYN: Today, the average data volume in an organization is growing at over 30 percent a year, and many are growing at an even faster rate.  Build a formal system for data control and oversight, and that includes structured processes and accountabilities.

## **What is data governance?**

Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.

Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture.

Note: ***Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.***

 *Enterprise information management (EIM*) - Enterprise information management (EIM) is defined as the optimization, storage and processing of data within an enterprise through the combined power of business intelligence or analytics and content management.

**Data Governance Versus Data Management**

Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs)

**Data Governance versus Information Governance**

Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning vs Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

**The Value of Data Governance**

- **Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.**

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance

**Creating a Data Governance Program**

 Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure.

Note: ***The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. I’ll be blunt about this: Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed.***

## **Preparing for Data Governance**

What is a data culture?

- A data culture is the collective behaviors and beliefs of people who value, practice and encourage the use of data to improve decision-making.

**Assessing the Data Culture**

- Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work.

**Maturing the Data Culture**

- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model
- Provide basic tools and education for data use
- Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress.
- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey.

**Assessing Data Governance Readiness**

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.

### **Overview**

In this chapter, we will be:

- Defining data and its relationship to information
- Exploring the role of data in the 21st century
- Moving from data to insights
- Discovering the impact of big data

**Defining Data**

Data has a specific meaning and it’s really important to be clear on the definition, particularly as we start talking about information, knowledge, and insights. 

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

- **Structured:** Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
- **Unstructured:** Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
- **Semi-structured:** Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

Datum = Single units of data and multiple units as data. 

 Data processing = *information technology (IT)*

## **The Zettabyte Era**

| Unit | Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| Kilobytes (KB) | 1,000 bytes | a paragraph of a text document |
| Megabytes (MB) | 1,000 Kilobytes | a small novel |
| Gigabytes (GB) | 1,000 Megabytes | Beethoven’s 5th Symphony |
| Terabytes (TB) | 1,000 Gigabytes | all the X-rays in a large hospital |
| Petabytes (PB) | 1,000 Terabytes | half the contents of all US academic research libraries |
| Exabytes (EB) | 1,000 Petabytes | about one fifth of the words people have ever spoken |
| Zettabytes (ZB) | 1,000 Exabytes | as much information as there are grains of sand on all the world’s beaches |
| Yottabytes (YB) | 1,000 Zettabytes | as much information as there are atoms in 7,000 human bodies |

PB =TB 

EB= PB

ZB = EB

YB = ZB

## The Differences Between Data and Information

## **The Role of Data in the 21st Century**

Arrival of the Internet in the mid-1990s = Information Industry Association’s 1970’s motto, “Putting information at your fingertips.” 

Data-driven decision-making -  Example would be deciding on a restaurant based on reviews.

Without good data and the skills and tools to analyze it, a bad and costly decision may result. This happens far too often.

Without good data and the skills and tools to analyze it, a bad and costly decision may result. This happens far too often.

 Clive Humby in 2006 “data is the new oil”. O***il and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form.***

## Data Ownership

 ****

- **The possession of and responsibility for information**. Data owners have the ability to access, create, modify, package, derive benefit from, sell, or remove data, as well as the right to assign these access privileges to others.

## **Data Architecture**

- It sets the blueprint for data and the way it flows through data storage systems.  data architecture **describes how data is managed--from collection through to transformation, distribution, and consumption.**
- An enterprise architecture (EA) is **a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of organizations**. The intent of enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can effectively achieve its current and future objectives.

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

- Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
- Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
- Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
- Adopting and agreeing to data standards
- Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication
- 

Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. 

## The Lifecycle of Data

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/47b3cc62-54bf-42ab-91cc-f690560c675b/4c923f4d-3fc5-4e5e-a9e7-16bcfd13a08c/Untitled.png)

- **Creation:**  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally.
- **Storage:**  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored
- **Usage:**  Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful.
- **Archival:**  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment.
- **Destruction:**  Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

Data Governance: ***For example, the security needs of data being regularly used will differ from data in an archival state.***

## **Understanding the Impact of Big Data**

- Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s.
- Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.
- The Tabulating Machine Company was later renamed International Business Machines, IBM.

One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

- **Volume:** The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
- **Variety:** There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
- **Velocity:** With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
- **Variability:** The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
- **Veracity:** The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.
